# KADE-submission3
This is my submission for the third assessment project in Dicoding "Kotlin Android Developer Expert" course. In the third part of this course, we have learned how to manage data with SQLite. For this submission we have to modify the application in the previous submission (Football Match Schedule) by adding a feature to save the match schedule to the Favorite page.

### Application Criteria
Some features that must be added to the application:

- **Favorite Match** : Features to accommodate favorite matches with criteria:

  * Can add matches to the favorite database.
  * Can delete matches from the favorite database.
  * Showing list of favorite matches.
  
- **Maintain the previous submission feature**

### Notes
* You are free to be creative in making this application. 
* You are free to use third-party networking libraries, for example Retrofit, Rx, etc.
* It is allowed to use Anko SQLite, Room, and others.
* In compiling views it is allowed to use Anko Layout or XML.

**The opportunity for your submission to be accepted will be greater if:**
* The list of favorite matches that are displayed can be updated automatically when adding or deleting favorite matches.
* Implement SQLite properly.
* Write the code clean
